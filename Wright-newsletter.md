## K-Pop
### Korea's hidden secret and the U.S.'s next new obsession.

Wonder what that music playing in the background during the Olympics was?

Or recognize these guys from the AMA's?

If both of these examples are foreign to you, well you're right. This is K-Pop or *Korean pop music*.

K-Pop has been around since the 90's, but it hasn't  gained significant attention in the states until recent past months.

Why this sudden popularity? Well, K-Pop has been popular in Asia from the beggining, but recent rise in multimedia platforms has cause widespread globalization of the genre. Platforms such as YouTube hosts various K-Pop artists and their music videos, some of which have over hundreds of millions of views [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdVXkSdhwU).

Social media is also a huge component into the recent success of K-Pop artists in the U.S. As opposed to American artists who tend to live private lives, Korean artists (or idols are they are called in Korea) are the exact opposite. With the use of platforms such as Twitter and VLIVE (an app that allows Korean celebrities to personally broadcast themselves) fans are granted higher access to the artists and thus establish a closer emotional connection to the music stars. Along with this lyrics which were once incomprehensible to non-Korean speakers can easily access translations on any of these social outlets making their music  *accessible* to a broader range of individuals.

Along with this, K-Pop just *does more.* What I mean by this is that the entertainment companies which form K-pop groups and artists devote much more time *training* and *perfecting* the groups they create. As a result, the music produced is catchy, the dances performed are difficult and impressive, and the overall experience they create is *better*.

So, does this mean the end of American music entirely? No, of course American music and artists are still widely more popular in the U.S., and globally American music will always have a position in the music market. However, American artists should be aware that there is an entirely other music industry across the world, and they are more than ready to take over.
